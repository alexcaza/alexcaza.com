		      <p>After a few years of trying to figure out why my anxiety had been steadily getting worse and why eating seemed to be causing me distress, I finally figured out the issue!</p>
		      <p>After starting anti-depressants, and the background anxiety was removed, I was still noticing pain, fatigue, anxiety and extreme bloating after meal-time. Turns out, I have celiac disease! Now that I follow a strict gluten-free diet, all of my symptoms have gone away. Barring the occasional glutening, which brings them all right back.</p>

					<p>I used to love drawing as a kid, but fell out of it for a number of reasons. Over the years, I've tried to pick it back up but it never stuck. This time around, I learned about urban sketching, and a new, looser style, of drawing that's really captured my attention.</p>
					<p>I don't have any work online, yet. But, I'll update this once I deem my stuff good enough to post. ;)</p>

					<p>Playing guitar is something I've wanted to learn since I was less than 10 years old. I've tried two times in the past to learn, but it never stuck. I always found it too difficult. Now, as an adult with a much higher tolerance for sucking at new skills, I've decided to give it a try again.</p>
					<p>It hasn't even been a month yet (Jan 6, 2025) but I'm really enjoying the progress I've made and learning a new, physical, skill!</p>

		      <p>
		        After YouTube sent me down the film photography rabbit hole, I got my
		        parent's old 35mm cameras and went all-in. Having shot on digital since
		        I was 13, it's been a wonderful change.
		      </p>
		      <p>
		        The slow, imperfect and physical nature of it all really spoke to me.
		        Much like how manual pour overs and pulling espresso shots require
		        focused attention, so does film photography.

		      <h1 id="fitness">Bouldering</h1>
		      <p>
		        I had gone bouldering a few times many, many years ago and greatly
		        enjoyed it. For whatever reason, it never stuck. It wasn't until my
		        brother-in-law fell deep into the rabbit hole, and couldn't shut up
		        about it, that I tried it again. I've only been going once a week, but
		        I'm hooked. It's a wonderful activity.
