# alexcaza.com source code

Welcome to the source code of my personal website! It used to be hosted over at GitLab, and was built using a bespoke Clojure static site generator.

In an effort to simplify my life a bit, and play around with a new tool, I moved it over to Astro.

Feel free to poke around or submit PRs if you see things that could be improved (like typos in my written content)!
